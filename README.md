#### Todo App

This small React project was developed as a training exercise while following along with a [YouTube video tutorial](https://youtu.be/pCA4qpQDZD8) by Simo Edwin ([Dev Ed](https://github.com/developedbyed)).

The project uses React to create a simple Todo app. Todo items are generated and rendered to the DOM when the user presses enter, using the `setFiltered` state to avoid modifying the original array of Todos during filtering. The user can mark items as completed or uncompleted and can also delete items from the todo list, removing them from both the localStorage and the project's state.

Filtering functionality is included, allowing the user to view `all`, `complete`, or `incomplete` tasks in the list.

Todos are saved to local storage and can be accessed via the `setTodos` state.
